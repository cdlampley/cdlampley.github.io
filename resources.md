<h1>Resources</h1>
I thought it would be helpful to create this resource page. I wanted to help in showing what I use to create my videos as well as this website. This page will be updated on a regular basis if I decide to use a different or new product. I hope this helps if you are deciding to start a blog or YouTube channel.

<h3>Camera</h3>

<a href="“http://amzn.to/1Eu7zqo”">Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS</a> |
You can get started on making videos with the webcam on your computer or even the camera on your phone. I have a couple videos on my channel from my web cam. I am currently using this Canon. I've had this camera for a number of years and it works fine. I do plan to upgrade, but since it takes me a while to research, I'll probably have this camera for a while longer.

<h3>Memory Card</h3>

<a href="&quot;http://amzn.to/1O26gPj">Trascend Memory Card</a> |
Whenever you get a camera, make sure you get a memory card. I have a few of these. I believe I decided on Transcend because I heard they're great and they are inexpensive.

<h3>Lighting</h3>

<a href="http://amzn.to/1O23mtQ">Lighting Kit by LimoStudios</a> |
Natural lighting is great. I'm not able to film, a lot, in the afternoon though. Also, during the Fall and Winter, the sun goes down earlier. That is where this lighting kit comes into play. I've been using it with some of my recent videos and I've seen improvements.

<a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/">iMovie</a> |
I currently use iMovie. I really enjoy it. I've used it for years and have seen the updates that have been made. I haven't decided if I will upgrade to Final Cut Pro X or Adobe. Maybe in the future, but as of right now, iMovie works great.

<h3>Tripod</h3>

<br>
<a href="http://amzn.to/1O254vd">Targus Tripod</a> |
The reason I was using my web cam is because the tripod I used to have was broken. I found this one at an inexpensive price (I'm all about finding ways to save money). I really like this tripod. I can stand or sit while filming. I love options.

<h3>Web Hosting</h3>

<a href="http://partners.hostgator.com/c/178240/176502/3094">HostGator</a> |
I've been using HostGator all year for this website and I really do like it. It is very easy to use. It is reliable. There was a very easy Wordpress setup as well. I highly recommend using HostGator.

I've started using Aweber for my email newsletter. It's pretty great so far and easy to use. A lot of the newsletters that I subscribe to use Aweber.
