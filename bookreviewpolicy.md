<h1>Book Review Policy</h1>

Hello! I am happy to accept review copies (print or e-book format) on occasion. I love reading and sharing books with others. I really enjoy reviewing books and giving a book more exposure.

I read both Adult and Young Adult fiction. Below you will find my preferred genres to read and review for both markets.  I will post my reviews on Goodreads, this website, and/or on my YouTube channel.

<b>Review Request Guidelines:</b><br>
I will always give an honest review.<br>
Submitting a request does not guarantee a review.<br>
Self-Published novels will be considered as well.<br>

<b>Preferred Genres:</b><br>
Contemporary<br>
Mystery & Thrillers<br>
Paranormal<br>
Science Fiction/Dystopian<br>
