<p><strong>First</strong>: I had forgotten that this blog existed. I mean, I have been in the process of moving my podcast blog over to Wordpress from Squarespace and I clicked on this blog. The last time I updated it was in 2008. That seems like forever ago. But, it felt like the perfect fit for my blog. I'll have this as my personal blog and The Sports Diva Report stuff is over at <a href="http://thesportsdivareport.wordpress.com">http://thesportsdivareport.com</a> right now if you want to check it out. Now back to the regular scheduled program.</p>
<p>Back in January, I made a blog post regarding my resolutions for 2014. Since its the halfway point, here are my updates.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong style="color:#666666;">1. Read more books!</strong><br style="color:#666666;" /><span style="color:#666666;">Last year, I didn’t read as many books as I wanted. That will change this year. I’m just going to read and read and read. I’ll make sure to blog about all of my happy reading.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I am in fact reading more books! I've read 8 books so far, 5 of them being in the Harry Potter series. I've gotten back to reading on a regular basis and I love it.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong style="color:#666666;">2. Finish this novel and start my next one.</strong><br style="color:#666666;" /><span style="color:#666666;">I’m excited about my writing right now. I actually haven’t been this excited about my writing before. Maybe that’s a good sign that I will actually finish something.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>I'm still working on this one. At the beginning of the year, I was working on a novel that just wasn't going anywhere for me. I started on a new one in April and am 18,000 words in. I am loving the characters and the story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color:#666666;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">3. Blog more.</strong><br />
My blogging for the last few years has been abysmal. Seriously, I used to blog all the time. This won’t be an everyday blog. I can’t promise that. That promise would mostly get broken on the first day. I might even start vlogging again. Maybe. Possibly. If I do, you’ll know all about it on this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has sort of happened. In migrating my blog posts over, I've separated the sports stuff out. Does podcasting work here? I consider podcasting working here. The podcast though is on hiatus. That is a whole other conversation. You can blame the book I'm writing for that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="color:#666666;"><strong style="font-style:inherit;">4. Stop threatening to throw furniture/electronics during games. </strong><br />
I would have to say I’ve gotten better at this while I’m watching my favorite teams. I used to threaten throwing my computer out the window. Now I just give it a stern look. I will continue getting better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="color:#666666;">I can honestly say that I haven't....that I don't remember threatening any furniture/electronics during games.</p>
<p style="color:#666666;">I think I've done pretty well with my resolutions. I also added on learning web development. HTML, CSS, javascript, and jquery have been learned by me. And I'm not done. We will see where this takes me.</p>
