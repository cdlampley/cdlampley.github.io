<p>I will be combining my February and March wrap up. I will probably be doing that going forward. Taking my web developer class and writing has changed how much I'm able to read. I've also changed my <a title="2015 Reading Challenge" href="http://cherielampley.com/blog/2015-reading-challenge/">2015 reading challenge</a>. I hope to get more reading done this month. I can't guarantee it, but here is to hoping. Some books will show down below that I was not able to get to in February.</p>
