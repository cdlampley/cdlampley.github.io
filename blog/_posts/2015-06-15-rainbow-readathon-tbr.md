<p>Another week, another readathon. This week, the Rainbow Readathon will begin. Starting June 15th and ending June 21st. I found out about this readathon from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jggt6F2HZXk">GingerReadsLainey</a> on youtube. The rules are to pick books that have spines the colors of the rainbow. You can do books from the different colors or read all of one color. You can also double up on 2 colors on a spine. I picked to do a book from each color of the rainbow. I have 6 books. Doubtful that I will read all 6, but I wanted to have options. Let me know if you are participating in the readathon. There is a twitter hashtag, of course. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rainbowthon?src=hash">#rainbowthon</a>. I will be using that when I can. Happy reading!</p>
