<p style="text-align:left;">My goal for this read-a-thon is to read the Divergent Series. I'm a hundred pages in with Divergent. I read Divergent earlier this year before the movie came out, but I recently bought the box set and I wanted to re-read Divergent and finish the series.</p>

<p>If there is time left after that, I will finish Americanah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">I've currently put it down to read Isla and the Happily Ever After over the weekend. I really like Americanah. I'm just not reading it as fast as I want to. So I'm gonna use this read-a-thon to speed up my reading and then, hopefully, when I get back to Americanah it will be all breezy.</p>
