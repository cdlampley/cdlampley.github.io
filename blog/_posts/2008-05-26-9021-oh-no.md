<p>Why are they insulting me with this? If I want to watch 90210, I will turn my TV to Soapnet. Not sure why they had to try to bring back 90210. Couldn't they have made something else? And why oh why did Michael from the Wire get sucked into this? Oh and the girl from Degrassi is here too. Can't take it.</p>
<p>Maybe after I see one episode I might change my mind and like this show. But not now! I am against it. The show has only been off the air for 8 years. What's next a remake of Party of 5? Just thinking about it is giving me a headache.</p>
