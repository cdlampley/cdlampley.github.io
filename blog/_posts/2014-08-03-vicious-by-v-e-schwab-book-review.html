<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Short Summary</strong></span><br />
Victor and Eli were college roommates. Both had to decide on a college thesis. Eli chose EO's, the ExtraOrdinary. This choice intrigued Victor and he took it upon himself to "help" Eli with this thesis. He decided that they should become EO's. Ten years later, they want the other dead. We follow Victor and Eli on the night they come head to head, their past, and we meet wonderful new characters (Mitch, Sydney, Serena, Dol). A thrilling ride from start to finish.</p>

OH MY GAWD! I still owe a review to this blog on the Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone trilogy. I'm getting to that. I finished the last book in the trilogy last weekend and I loved it. And after I finished reading it, I went into mourning. I picked up book after book after book, trying to figure out what to read next. Nothing felt right. Then I picked up Vicious.</p>
<p>How do I describe how much I love this book? I guess by just saying I love this book. I don't think that's good enough though. I feel like I need to do something. To show this book my appreciation. To show the author my appreciation. THIS. BOOK. RIGHT. HERE. Go buy it. Buy it for yourself. Buy it for a family member. Buy it for a friend. I really don't think you'll be disappointed. I could be wrong. Everyone doesn't have the same taste. There is a quote in the beginning of the book.</p>
<blockquote><p>Life -- the way it really is -- is a battle not between Bad and Good, but between Bad and Worse.<br />
- Joseph Brodsky</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel like I'm rambling. I don't even know what else to say. The main characters of this book are terrible people. Or maybe they just do terrible things. Doesn't matter. I still love them. I will definitely be rereading this. Vicious is my favorite book I've read so far this year.</p>
<p>5/5 stars</p>
