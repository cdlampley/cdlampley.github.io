<p>I watch a lot of TV. A LOT! And I can&#8217;t wait until Fall TV comes back. Below is a list of 5 shows* (as wells as honorable mention) I can&#8217;t wait to begin.</p>
<p><b>1.</b>  <b>The Office.</b> This show puts a smile on my face. I can&#8217;t explain it but I can&#8217;t live without this show. I spent last weekend watching episodes (seasons worth) of this show on Netflix. I know get a life. But why do I need one when I have The Office? Oh and I gave up Grey&#8217;s Anatomy for this show. At least during football season. I have to be able to see what&#8217;s happening during the Thursday night college football game. I can&#8217;t do that if I&#8217;m recording 2 things at the 9&#160;o&#8217;clock hour.</p>
<p><b>2.</b>  <b>Glee.</b> I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve mentioned how happy I was after watching the pilot of this new series. I fell in love. I looked to see when this show would be on and it&#8217;s Wednesday&#8217;s at 9. Phew. No conflicts with other shows. I will say this though. If I had to choose between this show and the next show on this list I would have to say goodbye to Gossip Girl. The pilot episode affected me that much.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>  <b>Gossip Girl.</b> Luckily I won&#8217;t have to say goodbye to the show New York Magazine calls &#8220;the greatest show of our time&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know about all that anymore (Glee has really affected me) but yes I do love this show.</p>
<p><b>4.</b>  <b>30 Rock.</b> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck1SP2vzBuY" target="_blank">Where&#8217;s my sandwich!</a> Enough said. Although I&#8217;m gonna need to see the &#8220;you&#8217;ll all have chins part&#8221;. If you don&#8217;t understand what I mean once I find it you will.</p>
<p><b>5.</b>  <b>The Big Bang Theory.</b> what can I say.  Another show I don&#8217;t like to miss.</p>
<p><i><b>honorable mention:</b> ugly betty, the cleveland show, family guy, the simpsons, how I met your mother, community, parks &amp; recreation, dollhouse</i></p>
<p>*Friday Night Lights doesn&#8217;t begin until January I believe. If not they would be on this list.</p>
