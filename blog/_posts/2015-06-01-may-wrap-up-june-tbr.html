<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May Wrap Up</strong></span></p>
<p>During the month of May, I finished 4 books. 3 of those was during the <a href="http://boutofbooks.blogspot.com">Bout of Books</a> 13.0 readathon.</p>
<p><a href="http://cherielampley.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FullSizeRender2.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-3015 alignleft" src="assets/FullSizeRender2-216x300.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender(2)" width="216" height="300" /></a>1. <strong>Twilight by Stephenie Meyer</strong>. The first book I read in May was Twilight. This is the first time I've finished this book. I got halfway through it back in 2008 or 2009 and put it down because of some other book. I thought it was pretty good. I've seen all the movies and I believe it is time that I read the books. I will be starting New Moon soon. Just need to buy it.</p>

This is written by @dkny (the dkny pr girl) from Twitter. I thought this was a good book on learning about her experiences and giving advice on how to find your dream job.</p>

<p>3. <strong>#Girlboss by Sophia Amoruso</strong>. The title of this book is a hashtag. Outside of that, the book was pretty good. It details Sophia's journey from jobs she hated to starting an ebay business to founding Nasty Gal. I listened to it on audiobook and it went by quick.</p>

Very good book. It details the story of 3 elementary students in the early 80's in Atlanta. During this time, African American children are vanishing and end up found dead. As I said I thought this was a very good book. I loved getting the children's perspective.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">June TBR</span></strong></p>
<p>During the first week of June there is another readathon. It is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ix0n5x1DSI">#tbrtakedown</a>. There are 5 challenges. Here are the books I plan on reading during this readathon.<br />

<ol>
<li>A book that's been on your TBR shelf for over a year.</li>
<li>An unread sequel that has been on your TBR shelf.</li>
<li>A first book in a series on your TBR shelf.</li>
<li>An out of your comfort zone book on the TBR shelf.</li>
<li>A book from your most recent book haul.</li>
</ol>
<p>*The Darkest Minds covers both #1 &amp; #3. It depends how I'm doing. It might count as both.<br />
**My current read, Magonia, might count for #5. Depends on how far I get through it before this readathon begins.</p>
<p>Other books for June I may get to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Paper Towns</em> by John Green</li>
<li><em>Interview with the Vampire</em> by Anne Rice (carried on from May)</li>
<li><em>The Dream Thieves</em> by Maggie Stiefvater (carried on from May)</li>
</ul>
