<p>In my resolutions for this year, I decided I was going to take learning to code seriously. Here is what I said from that post.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong> Really Learn To Code.</strong> I've been attempting to learn to code throughout the last few years. I think I have some of the basics, but I really want to take this seriously this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>In January, I enrolled in the Skillcrush Web Development Blueprint. I had been looking at Skillcrush for about a year before even enrolling. I was receiving their newsletter and had visited their <a href="http://skillcrush.com/blog">blog</a> on a regular basis.</p>
