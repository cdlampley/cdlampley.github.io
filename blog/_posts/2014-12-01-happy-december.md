I remember at the end of October, I thought about blogging every day in November. I thought about it. Really thought about it. Then it didn't happen. Why? ¯_(ツ)_/¯ It just wasn't meant to be. For that month that is. I've decided I want to try my hand at blogging throughout December. I know the youtubers do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=vlogmas">Vlogmas</a> (vlog from December 1st to Christmas Day). I'll just do Blogmas! Is Blogmas a thing? A <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blogmas">twitter search</a> does say its a thing. So yay! That's me. Joining in on Blogmas.
