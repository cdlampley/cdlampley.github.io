<p>3 books. I read 3 books in September. One of them was an audiobook. Football came back. That's all I got. Football came back. It came back and took over my world. I was missing it and probably should have took that into consideration when I made my TBR. Also, do you notice something different about the books I read below and what was on my TBR? Didn't exactly stick to it.</p>
<strong>Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn</strong><br>
Love this book. Can't wait to see the movie. What can I say about this without giving anything away. Wife goes missing, husband becomes a suspect. Yep. That's all I'm saying. I "bullied" a couple coworkers of mine into reading it. They enjoyed it too. <em><strong>5/5 stars</strong></em><br>

<strong>The Thousand Dollar Tan Line by Rob Thomas and Jennifer Graham</strong><br>
Fun read. I love the show Veronica Mars. Hated when it was  cancelled. I did contribute to its Kickstarter campaign and  own the movie. This book starts off where the movie left off. I  believe there is another book coming out early next year. I'm sure that I'll get that. Also, I do recommend the audiobook. <del>Veronica Mars</del> Kristen Bell narrates it.
<em><strong>3.5/5 stars</strong></em><br>

<strong>MissPeregrine's Home For Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs</strong><br>
I'm a fan. This is the book I read after Gone Girl. It took me a  while to figure out which book I wanted to read after Gone Girl,   but this book fit my needs. The story focuses on Jacob whose grandfather has told him these stories about his childhood that Jacob has never believed. Then tradegy strikes and these stories become reality. I would suggest not going into this book thinking that its scary because of the pictures. Its an adventure story. That is what I would categorize it as. So sit back and enjoy this adventure. I'm going to have to purchase the sequel soon. <em><strong>5/5 stars</strong></em>
