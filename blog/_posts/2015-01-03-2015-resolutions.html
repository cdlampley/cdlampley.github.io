<p>It's a new year! With the new year, it's time for resolutions.</p>
<p>Here are my resolutions from 2014.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>1. Read more books!<br />
</strong><strong>2. Finish this novel and start my next one.<br />
</strong><strong>3. Blog more.<br />
</strong><strong>4. Stop threatening to throw furniture/electronics during games. </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I think I did decently. I read more, finished a rough draft of a novel, I blogged more, and have gotten better at threatening things during games. Now onto what I want to do in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>1. Finish Novel.</strong> Now that I have a rough draft, its time to polish it.</p>
<p><strong>2. Read 50 Books.</strong> Last year I read 36 books. I think I can read more than that. I say that now, of course. It's January. Of course I believe I can do anything now. I might as well change it to 150 books. That's a joke. I'm pretty sure for me to do that, I wouldn't sleep.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Really Learn To Code.</strong> I've been attempting to learn to code throughout the last few years. I think I have some of the basics, but I really want to take this seriously this year.</p>
<p><strong>4. More Sports Related Things.</strong> Whether that's through writing or podcasting. I've taken enough time off from writing about sports. I have an idea of a podcast. I just don't know if I have the time. Until I can figure that out, I'm sure I'll put up some pieces on Medium. At least I better.</p>
