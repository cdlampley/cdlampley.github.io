<p><strong>Day:</strong> #3&#160;<br /><strong>Current Read:</strong> The Magicians by Lev Grossman <br /><strong>Books Finished:</strong> 1&#160;<br /><strong>Pages Read Since Last Update:</strong> 42&#160;<br /><strong>Total Pages Read in Read-A-Thon:</strong> 406&#160;<br /><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Yesterday was a busy day at work for me. I didn&#8217;t even have time to read during lunch. I took Insurgent to work with me and read 11 pages on my way home. Then when I got home, I looked over at my bookshelf and decided The Magicians is the book I want to read right now. I hope to finish it in the next few days. I only read a little last night because I was tired.</p>
