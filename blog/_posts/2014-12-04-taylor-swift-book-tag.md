<p style="text-align:center;">This tag was created by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaFRgPdxK3A">The Book Life</a>. Fun tag. Turn up some T. Swift and let's do this!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1. We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</strong><br />
(pick a book or series that you were pretty sure you were in love with, but then wanted to break up with)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="" src="assets/6101718.jpg" alt="The Magicians (The Magicians, #1)" width="231" height="355" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">When I started the book, I was very happy. And then I kept reading and kept being annoyed and annoyed with everything. I haven't decided if I will continue on with this trilogy. Maybe? Possibly?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2. Red</strong><br />
(pick a book with a red cover)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="" src="assets/6148028.jpg" alt="Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, #2)" width="234" height="361" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3. The Best Day</strong><br />
(pick a book that makes you feel nostalgic)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="" src="assets/317500.jpg" alt="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia, #1)" width="218" height="357" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I remember reading this in elementary. I need to get a copy. I need to get a copy of the entire series. I don't think I actually read the others.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4. Love Story</strong><br />
(pick a book with a forbidden love)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13528340-daughter-of-smoke-bone?from_search=true"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/13528340.jpg" alt="Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone (Daughter of Smoke and Bone, #1)" width="249" height="379" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I love this book. This couple is great. Karou &amp; Akiva 4-EVA!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5. I Knew You Were Trouble</strong><br />
(pick a book with a bad character you couldn't help but love)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13638125-vicious?from_search=true"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/13638125.jpg" alt="Vicious" width="259" height="386" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Everyone is terrible. Victor. Eli. Serena. Oh goodness Serena. Everyone is terrible. Everyone is awesome. READ THIS!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6. Innocent</strong><br />
(pick a book that someone ruined the ending for)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="" src="assets/7260188.jpg" alt="Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, #3)" width="239" height="369" />  <img class="" src="assets/17383918.jpg" alt="Allegiant (Divergent, #3)" width="245" height="371" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I don't get upset over being spoiled the majority of the time. I do my best not to get spoiled. These were just accidents. I think I was watching a youtube video and someone said the Mockingjay thing and I was like "oh". It still didn't stop me from being horribly sad when I read it actually happening! Either twitter or youtube or tumblr spoiled Allegiant. I will still read though. I want to know how it gets to that point.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>7. Everything Has Changed</strong><br />
(pick a character from a book who goes through extensive character development)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="" src="assets/17453983.jpg" alt="Anna and the French Kiss (Anna and the French Kiss, #1)" width="233" height="349" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I was trying to figure out how to answer this. I couldn't think of anything and then I remember reading this book earlier this year. It was so cute. Anna did change a lot from the beginning of the book until the end. I was proud of her. haha</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>8. You Belong With Me</strong><br />
(most anticipated book release)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17901125-the-mime-order?from_search=true"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/22055262.jpg" alt="A Darker Shade of Magic (A Darker Shade of Magic, #1)" width="222" height="335" /></a>   <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17901125-the-mime-order?from_search=true"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/17901125.jpg" alt="The Mime Order (The Bone Season, #2)" width="215" height="336" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">So ready for both of these books to be released in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>9. Forever and Always</strong><br />
(favorite book couple)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I don't have one. Seriously. I have no clue what the answer to this question would be. I feel as if I haven't met them yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>10. Come Back, Be Here</strong><br />
(pick the book you would least like to lend out, for fear of missing it too much)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ALL OF THEM! Look. I've loaned out my book to people before. Once to a friend's boyfriend and I never saw that book back because they broke up :( Then I've loaned out books and, well, they've come back falling apart. I have one friend I will lend my books to. She has a history of giving them back nicely. I love looking over and seeing books on my book shelf.</p>
