<p>I am excited to share something new with you all.</p>
<p>I am creating Tech Tip Thursday on this website! There are a lot of tech tips out there and I want to share them with everyone. Whether it is "how to schedule post on Twitter" or "best apps to use to edit photos"; I want to help you all.</p>
