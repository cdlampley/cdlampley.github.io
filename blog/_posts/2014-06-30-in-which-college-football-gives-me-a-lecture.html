<p>Sometimes the Big Ten Network and ESPN show reruns of college football games. I'm here for them. Especially in the summer time when I'm missing football the most. The thing is though, I'm supposed to be writing around the time there might be a game on that may be of interest. So I end up taking a break from writing and watching. Recently, the below exchange happened. And now these "classic" games will never feel the same.</p>
<p><strong>College Football:</strong> What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> huh?</p>
<p><strong>College Football:</strong> What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I was just --</p>
<p><strong>College Football:</strong> Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> *frowns* It's only --</p>
<p><strong>College Football:</strong> Aren't you supposed to be writing?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>College Football:</strong> Aren't you close to finishing this draft?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> Then why are you watching us on ESPNU and BTN? These games are old. You've seen these games.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I miss you?</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> Is that a question?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong>  No.</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> Then why did you ask? Aren't you supposed to be a writer?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> ............................................</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> ...........................................</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> Are we back to you feeling sorry for yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> *blinks*</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> You want to write, right?</p>
<p><strong>ME: </strong>*laughs*</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> *death stare*</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> I'll ask again. Aren't you supposed to be a writer?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>CF:</strong> ACT LIKE IT!</p>
<p>This either happened for real or just in my head. Actually, that's the same thing. You don't believe me? Ask Dumbledore.</p>
