<p>Not mine, of course. But my brother is getting married and I haven't gotten a chance to hang out with him and my sisters in a while. I live in Columbus, he lives near Dayton, one sister is in Cincy, and my other sister is in Atlanta. So it will be good.<br />Oh, I get to eat wedding cake! You don't know how much I love wedding cake. I will get married just for that. Oh and if I'm in love of course. Pics will come later. I have to use the camera on my Centro since I forgot my digital. We'll see how good it is. </p>
