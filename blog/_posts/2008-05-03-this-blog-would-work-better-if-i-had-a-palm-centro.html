<p>Look at it. REALLY! Take a good look at it. It's adorable, right? I should have it, right? Well, <a href="http://www.sprint.com" target="_blank">Sprint</a> says that I have to wait until July 1st to get 2 year rebate on it. That will be 22 months that I've had my current phone. What sucks is that they used to let you get a new phone with the full rebate after 18 months. I would be holding my <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/centro/?creativeID=US_BB_centro_sprint_combo_v2" target="_blank">Palm Centro</a> in my hand right now if it was still that way. But no. They just want to PISS me off.</p>
<p>Of course I could blog when I get home from work but how fun would it be for me to blog while on the COTA? I have my ipod nano, yes I bought it and love it, so all I need is a Palm Centro. I'm counting down the days. Now if someone wanted to donate one to me, that would be great. Good for you. Shout me out an email. But seriously, I really REALLY want one. Remember that toy when you were a kid that you wanted so bad but didn't want to wait until Christmas or your birthday to open it. That is what this is to me. Some how I HAVE to get it.</p>
