<p style="text-align:left;">Well, hello there. How are you? Me? I'm fine. Better than fine after these books came into my life this year. I finished the Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone trilogy in July. Yeah, I know. Why did I wait a month for my write up? I have no answer for that. I'm too busy trying to figure out when I can re-read them.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Here is a brief summary of the first book from G<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8490112-daughter-of-smoke-bone?from_search=true">oodreads</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Around the world, black handprints are appearing on doorways, scorched there by winged strangers who have crept through a slit in the sky.<br />
In a dark and dusty shop, a devil’s supply of human teeth grows dangerously low.<br />
And in the tangled lanes of Prague, a young art student is about to be caught up in a brutal otherwordly war.<br />
Meet Karou. She fills her sketchbooks with monsters that may or may not be real, she’s prone to disappearing on mysterious "errands", she speaks many languages - not all of them human - and her bright blue hair<em>actually</em> grows out of her head that color. Who is she? That is the question that haunts her, and she’s about to find out.<br />
When beautiful, haunted Akiva fixes fiery eyes on her in an alley in Marrakesh, the result is blood and starlight, secrets unveiled, and a star-crossed love whose roots drink deep of a violent past. But will Karou live to regret learning the truth about herself?</p>
