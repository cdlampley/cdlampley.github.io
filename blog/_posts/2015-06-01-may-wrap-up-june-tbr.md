<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>May Wrap Up</strong></span></p>
<p>During the month of May, I finished 4 books. 3 of those was during the <a href="http://boutofbooks.blogspot.com">Bout of Books</a> 13.0 readathon.</p>

<strong>Twilight by Stephenie Meyer</strong>. The first book I read in May was Twilight. This is the first time I've finished this book. I got halfway through it back in 2008 or 2009 and put it down because of some other book. I thought it was pretty good. I've seen all the movies and I believe it is time that I read the books. I will be starting New Moon soon. Just need to buy it.

<strong>Leave Your Mark by Aliza Licht</strong>. This is written by @dkny (the dkny pr girl) from Twitter. I thought this was a good book on learning about her experiences and giving advice on how to find your dream job.

<strong>#Girlboss by Sophia Amoruso</strong>. The title of this book is a hashtag. Outside of that, the book was pretty good. It details Sophia's journey from jobs she hated to starting an ebay business to founding Nasty Gal. I listened to it on audiobook and it went by quick.<br>
<p><img class=" size-medium wp-image-3014 alignleft" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UI35WLeQL._SX308_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="FullSizeRender" width="216" height="300" /></p>
<strong>Leaving Atlanta by Tayari Jones</strong>. Very good book. It details the story of 3 elementary students in the early 80's in Atlanta. During this time, African American children are vanishing and end up found dead. As I said I thought this was a very good book. I loved getting the children's perspective.

<h3>June TBR</h3> 
<p>During the first week of June there is another readathon. It is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ix0n5x1DSI">#tbrtakedown</a>. There are 5 challenges. Here are the books I plan on reading during this readathon.<br />
