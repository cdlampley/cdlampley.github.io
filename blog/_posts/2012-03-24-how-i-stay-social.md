<p>If you know me you know that I have two loves: sports and <strike>twitter </strike>social media. But being that there are so many different social networks out there, its hard sometimes to figure out how to incorporate these networks into your life. So I&#8217;ve decided I will share how I use some of these networks. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is my favorite. I&#8217;ve been using Twitter since 2007 and fell in love the moment I sent out my first 140 character tweet. If I was told I could only use one social network for the rest of my life it would be this one. I use Twitter to say hi to the world. I use Twitter to talk to friends during sporting events (#gobucks is a favorite hashtag of mine). I&#8217;ve met some really cool people on Twitter and actually talk to some of these people outside of the social network. I use Twitter to get my news. Seriously. I don&#8217;t watch the news, I go to Twitter instead.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. My favorite thing about Facebook is the messenger app. Oh and that I can use Facebook to sign up for other social networks by using Facebook Connect. Its not my favorite but I use it since most of my friends and family use it. I was actually just looking at my Facebook timeline and noticed that mostly everything on there is from a different social network. I barely even put pics on Facebook anymore because they go to Flickr and Flickr lets Facebook know I&#8217;ve added a new pic. So I guess I use Facebook to show how I use all the other social networks. And to chat with friends through messenger. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.path.com" target="_blank">Path</a>. Oh how I love Path. Slowly but surely I will get my friends to use Path. I got them to use Twitter so this will happen. Path calls itself a smart journal and I agree. And the interface is pretty awesome. It is an app for your friends and family or people that you actually talk to. Yes, some people use Facebook for people they actually talk to but some (like me) befriended people that they went to high school that they don&#8217;t remember or people from their hometown they barely spoke to when they were there. Of course you could just go through your friend list and delete these people. I don&#8217;t feel like doing that. I friended them there. Whatever goes on Facebook, they will see. And yes, I can post through Path to Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and Tumblr. Most of the time though what I put on Path, only goes on Path. So I use Path for pics, notes, what I&#8217;m listening to at the moment, where I am, etc. Path just might actually be my journal.</p>
<p><a href="http://instagr.am" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. Since I got the iPhone over a month ago, I had to download this app and see what all the fuss was about. And yes I am hooked. Most of the pics I take with my phone go through instagram (Some only go through Path). Then I share that pic to twitter and/or flickr, tumblr, and foursquare. But instagram is not just for sharing. Its a social network too. I check out the pics of the people I follow, comment, like, and check out hashtags. I&#8217;m hoping the Android app comes soon so that my friends can use it. And yes, you will like it.</p>
<p><a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a>. Oh the one that doesn&#8217;t get used. At least that is what the experts say. Well, in my experience with google+, a lot of people use it. My stream is always moving. All day. Every day. There is always a tab open on my browser to google+. I get a lot of the news I don&#8217;t get from Twitter from google+. I rarely use <a href="http://reader.google.com" target="_blank">googlereader</a> anymore. This is also a good place to meet new people like twitter. And then some of these people can be added to my Path since I do talk to them everyday. </p>
<p>These are the networks I use most often. There are new ones that I think about trying like <a href="http://www.mobli.com" target="_blank">mobli</a> and I also use <a href="http://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> to pin things I want or have. So what about you? Do you use anything different? Are there any networks I should try?</p>
