<p>So here we go. I'm just surprised that it took me this long to start a personal blog. Do I care if people read it? Sort of. I will definitely tell my friends about this though. Yes, I will still be blogging about sports over at <a href="http://www.tsdmagazine.com/">The Sports Diva Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.epiccarnival.com/">Epic Carnival</a> but here will consist of anything else I feel like talking about. My public journal. I hope to blog as much as possible here. Need to up my blogging over at TSD too. This will be interesting.</p>
