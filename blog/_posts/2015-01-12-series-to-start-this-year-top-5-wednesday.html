<p>Top 5 Wednesday is here! I joined the group on Goodreads sometime last year. This might be my first post. I don't remember. I did a <a title="Series I Want To Start â€“ Blogmas Day 10" href="https://cheriedlampley.wordpress.com/2014/12/10/series-i-want-to-start-blogmas-day-10/">series I want to start post</a> during Blogmas.
