<p>I decided to make a discussion video. I wanted to talk about books that become movie adaptations. I have noticed that I have watched a bunch of movies before reading the book or purchasing the book. Let me know what you guys think. Do you prefer to read a book before seeing a move? Will you wait to see a movie before reading the book?</p>
