<p>This should be my last Blogmas post. It was fun though! I missed a few days, but kept going. I'm going out of town for the Holiday and will be taking books of course. I have a week of reading on my hands. I won't be posting again until I do my favorite posts. I'm going to do multiple post this year. <a title="2013 Favorites" href="https://cheriedlampley.wordpress.com/2013/12/31/201312312013-favorites/">Last year</a> I just did one. This year there will be more to talk about. Anyway, I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday. Here are the books that will be coming with me. Some are physical books and some are on my Kindle. I hope to at least finish 2 of these. It would be awesome if I could do a bit more, but I'm not going to rush myself.</p>
