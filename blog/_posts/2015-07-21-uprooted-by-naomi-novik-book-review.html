<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Uprooted is the story of a group of villages and a forest called The Wood. The Wood has a lot of corruption and danger. If someone finds their way into The Wood, they either do not come out, or if they do come out, they are changed in not in a good way. These villages have protection from The Wood by a wizard named The Dragon. This protection, however, comes at a price. Every 10 years, the villages must give up a girl to The Dragon to serve him in his tower. After their time with The Dragon is up, they come back different. They are not the same girl that they were when they left. When they come back to the village, if they come back to the village, they are only there for a little while to see their family before leaving to make a home somewhere else.<br />
The Dragon makes his choice of which girl to serve him at a choosing ceremony. Every girl that is born in a certain year, the year they turn 17 will line up to see if they are the chosen one. The choosing ceremony is coming up and the villages have already decided on the girl who will be chosen by The Dragon. The girl chosen is typically very beautiful, talented, and brave. The girl for this ceremony the villages believe will be taken is Kasia. Her family has prepared for her to be taken since she was a little girl. The problem with this is she is not the girl The Dragon chooses.</p>
<h3>Why I Picked It Up</h3>
<p>Online buzz. Also, was in the mood for a fairy-tale retelling.</p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>

Uprooted is a story that once I finished I wanted to turn to the first page and start reading again. This is one of my favorite books Iâ€™ve read so far this year. There were hilarious moments. There were heartbreaking moments. The characters were wonderful. I recommend this book to anyone in the mood for a modern fairytale.</p>
