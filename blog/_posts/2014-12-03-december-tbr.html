<p>Another month, another TBR. This is a rather ambitious month for me. I checked my shelf the other night and decided I wanted to read all of the books. I don't know how much reading I will get done. I do know that my Saturdays have opened up. College football is on its way out :( But at least I'll have time to read more :)</p>
<p><strong>The books I believe I can definitely read this month:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The books I've decided I must read this month as well because...well...I've gone mad:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Harry Potter series</strong> (not all right? I can't think I'm going to read all the books above and read all the books in this series too? I could watch the movies. Maybe audiobooks? Hmm. We will see.)</p>
<p>2. <strong>The Queen of the Tearling by Erika Johansen.</strong> I was so excited to get this book when it came out. Bought it the week of its release. Its been sitting on my shelf ever since.</p>
<p>3. <strong>The Name of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss.</strong> Just realizing I haven't really picked any short books this month. So why not add this one to the bunch?</p>
<p>4. <strong>Endgame: The Calling by James Frey, Nils Johnson-Shelton.</strong> I got this book the other day at Target on sale. It was a late Black Friday shopping trip where I wasn't really shopping for Black Friday deals. Anyway, this books seems interesting. Some swear its a rip-off of The Hunger Games (love that trilogy). If I get to it this month, I guess I'll find out.</p>
