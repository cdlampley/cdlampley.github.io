<p>Well, I tried the serving thing again. Not really for me. I remember some of the reasons I stopped doing it in the first place. Like the hours and the money not always being great. Now as much as I liked the people that I did work with at the doctor's office, I rather could not stand the work. And besides, I want to work closer to home since I do take public transportation. Now if I went back to the doctor's office that means leaving home an hour and a half early and getting home an hour and a half late. So no thank you. Moving on...</p>
<p>The new job is a temporary assignment. I went to a temp agency and got an assignment that should last through the end of the year. I'm crossing my fingers that it will last a lot longer. </p>
<p>About school... It will happen. It didn't happen this quarter but I'm hoping for next quarter. I'll keep you posted. Now it's time to figure out what I'm going to wear tomorrow.</p>
