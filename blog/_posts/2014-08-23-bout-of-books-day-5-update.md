<p><strong>Day:</strong> #5&#160;<br /><strong>Current Read:</strong> The Magicians <br /><strong>Books Finished:</strong> 1&#160;<br /><strong>Pages Read Since Last Update:</strong> 65&#160;<br /><strong>Total Pages Read in Read-A-Thon:</strong> 535&#160;<br /><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Thank goodness the weekend is here! More time to read. I plan on finishing The Magicians either Saturday or Sunday. I plan on having time left in the read-a-thon in which I&#8217;ll pick up&#8230;something. I have no idea.  I guess I will figure that out. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me. I&#8217;m gonna go read.</p>
