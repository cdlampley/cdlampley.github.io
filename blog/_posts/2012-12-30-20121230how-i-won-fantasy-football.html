<p>Back in September I made a video detailing how I <i>hated</i> fantasy football. How I declared that this was the last year I would play fantasy football. If you don't remember that video, I've added it below.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">Well I would like to announce (on this blog that is. I've said it a bunch of times on twitter) that I actually won the twitter fantasy football league created by&nbsp;<a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/102667155036541865667" target="_blank">+John Davis</a>. How did I win? Well there are certain things you have to understand to win your fantasy football league. The most important thing to understand is...hahaha. I'm just kidding. A few months ago I hated fantasy football because I sucked at it. I would say I won because of the luck of the draw. The players I had got hot at the right time. I would compare my fantasy team this year to last years NY Giants.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">Here's my roster at the end of the season. I've changed players a few times but I can't really remember the players I cut. I do remember adding Alfred Morris though which was a great thing for me.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">QB: Eli Manning &amp; Tony Romo</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">RB: Adrian Peterson &amp; Alfred Morris &amp; Trent Richardson &amp; Vick Ballard</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">WR: Calvin Johnson &amp; Dez Bryant &amp; Justin Blackmon</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">TE: Jermaine Gresham &amp; Martellus Bennett</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">Defense: 49ers</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">K: Matt Prater (had Mike Nugent all season until he got hurt)</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">My record was 7-6. Coming into week 10 I was 3-6. I lost weeks 7, 8, and 9 and I wasn't too happy about it. Then the winning streak began. Then 159 points during Thanksgiving weekend happened. I had 90 something points on Thanksgiving day alone! Then Ohio State beat Michigan. Oh...that doesn't have to do with fantasy football? Oops :) Then I had to win the last regular season game just to make the playoffs.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">What I've learned is to win fantasy football, just have the players on your team that are gonna get hot at the right time. I'm sure that's easy, right?</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:left;">Now I know in the video I said I was not going to play next year but I feel like they will make me so that they can "beat the champ". So I guess I'm at least playing one more year. I better at least make the championship game. Then I could get there 3 years in a row. Come to think of it, maybe I don't suck at fantasy football as much as I think. At least until next September.</div>
