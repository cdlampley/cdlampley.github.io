<p>So...I signed up for the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/118368-top-5-wednesday">Top 5 Wednesday</a> group on Goodreads. As you can see. I have yet to post one of these. Although it isn't Wednesday, Blogmas is giving me time to catch up. This was one of the November topics. Books that I own that are over 500 pages. I have more than this, like Harry Potter. But since that would almost take up the entire list, I thought I'd try some other books.</p>
