<p>My main character is now depressed.</p>
<p>I'm still doing NaNoWriMo. I'm a little behind, but hopefully&nbsp;I'll be able to catch up. Either way, I still plan on finishing this novel. I'm enjoying writing this story actually. At least I was before I made my main character turn to alcohol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I don't have an outline for this book. At least not one that I have written down. I know the endpoint I want to reach in this story, I'm just driving without a map getting there. Well I just got to the part on figuring out why my main character doesn't have a love interest. Lets just say, she is one of those girls that likes to stay in one place. And if she takes a step forward, she freaks out and thinks that her life will be ruined. We all know it won't but she doesn't realize until its too late. She is one of those. Now she's going through some tough times and I'm going to have to see her through them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing break over.&nbsp;</p>
