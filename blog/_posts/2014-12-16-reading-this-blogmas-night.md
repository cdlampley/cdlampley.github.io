<p>I'm currently reading. I'm actually able to sit down and read tonight. That makes me happy. My current read is Red Rising by Pierce Brown. Currently on 209. I like this book. A lot. I've laughed, been sad, and shook my head saying "boys" out loud. I could probably already be finished with this. But other things have gotten in the way. Anyway, I'm just gonna read tonight. Just chill and read.</p>
