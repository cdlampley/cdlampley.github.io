<p>I've attempted to do NaNoWriMo many times. I think the first time was back in 2007. Not even sure I got 1 word that year. I'm sure I also attempted and failed before I even started in 2008, 2009, and 2010. 2011 was different. I got past the first word. I was nanowrimoing! Well...up until I got to around 23,000 words. But I at least got over 20,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now to this year. I will be participating. I will be writing everyday (I should do already but I don't. Oops.). I will get to 50,000 words this time. I will! I also added a widget on the right over there to show my progress. I'll update later on what my story is about. Time to get some writing done.</p>
