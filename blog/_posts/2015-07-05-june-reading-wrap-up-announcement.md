<p>I have been sorting out the different topics that I love to talk about. The Blank Space Newsletter is where I discuss sports. Don't forget to <a href="http://tinyletter.com/thesportsdiva">subscribe</a> to that by the way. If have been blogging about books here, but I didn't want to turn this into only a book blog. I plan on writing more post on other things (I promise, that is coming when I think of those things).</p>
<p>So I wanted to figure out where to discuss the books that I read. Do I start a new blog and turn it into a book blog? Or do I start making youtube videos and join the booktube community. Videos are my choice and I'm happy with that choice. I've made two vides so far, and have been welcome to the community with open arms. My first video is the Booktube Newbie Tag. You can watch that below. I also have my June Reading Wrap Up below as well. I'm all about the content!</p>
