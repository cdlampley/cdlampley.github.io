<p>So I <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">finished</span> made myself finish <em>Chasing Harry Winston</em>. I actually skimmed the last few pages to see what happened. It's not that I didn't like it. I wasn't horrible but it was just OK. I liked the idea of it and wished that it would have been better. Oh well. Can't get everything you want out of the book you're reading.</p>
<p>So now that I'm done with that one, I can go on to the next one I had at home that I needed to read, right? Wrong. I bought a new one. A book that I'm surprised that I've never read before. <em>Good In Bed</em> by <a href="http://www.jenniferweiner.com" target="_blank">Jennifer Weiner</a>. I'm only 50 pages in and I really like it. It shouldn't take me that long to read it. Then I can go back to books I have here. Yes, I won't buy new books for a while. No more books!</p>
