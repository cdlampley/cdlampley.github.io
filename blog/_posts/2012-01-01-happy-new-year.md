<p>Its 2012! I have to be honest. I did not see the ball drop. I woke up at 7 that morning (for some stupid reason) and then started drinking at around 7 that evening. After a while I was just sleepy. I was happy I didn’t go out though. Who knows what kind of craziness I would have gotten into. After the Ohio State basketball team lost to Indiana (ugh), it was best that I kept my butt home.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope everyone had a safe and happy night. Now, does everyone know what their resolutions are? You do? Good. What are mine? Well…here are a few I’ve been working on.</p>
<p>1) Last night was the first of 3 games in a row. Ohio State basketball lost but that doesn’t mean the Bengals and Ohio State football will too. However, if they do, I will stop threatening my electronic devices. My Macbook, Nook, and TV will know they are in a safe environment in 2012.</p>
<p>2) Remember NaNoWriMo and how I said I was going to finish that book? Yeah…I didn’t. At least in 2011. I will finish it this year. I will finish it or else (not sure what the or else is. Hopefully it won’t come to that).</p>
<p>3) I will no longer threaten my EVO when it yells at me for having low memory. I’m an app addict. I can admit that. I shouldn’t take it out on my EVO though. It isn’t fair. My upgrade is in April so I will have to be nice to my evo just for a few months.</p>
<p>That’s all I have for now. Oh and I guess I can eat better and be nicer.</p>
