<p style="text-align:center;">For some reason or another, I have started these 5 books and have yet to finish them. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood at the time. Maybe some other book was screaming at me on my shelf to read it. Maybe I wanted to just read or watch Harry Potter. There are many different possible reasons. I do plan on finishing them at some point. One day. One day I will. Here are the books. The Bone Clocks is on my TBR this year and the plan is still to read it.</p>
