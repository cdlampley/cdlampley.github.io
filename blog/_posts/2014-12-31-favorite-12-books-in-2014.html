<p>I had a really good reading year. I read 36 books. I got out of my over year long reading slump. Oh and reading helped me write better. Win win all around. I thought about picking 14 books and I also thought about picking 10. I finally decided on 12. My favorite 12 books I read in 2014. With a lot of people probably doing 14 books in 2014, my number seems weird, right? Whatever. The Big Ten has 14 teams and the Big XII has 10. I choose numbers just like my favorite sport. I have them in order below starting with number 12.</p>
<p>12.<strong> The 5th Wave by Rick Yancey.</strong> The setting of this book being in Southwest Ohio (where I grew up) gave this bonus points. The book didn't need those bonus points though to be on this list.</p>
<p>11. <strong>Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell.</strong> The internet made me read this. And I'm okay with it.</p>
<p>10. <strong>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan.</strong> Bookstores, secret societies, google...what is there not to love about this book?</p>
<p>9.<strong> The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins.</strong> Finally! I finally read this trilogy. AND I actually liked Mockingjay.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.</strong> This was fantastic. I bought the second one. Just haven't gotten around to read it. 2015 will change that.</p>
<p>7.<strong> The Bone Season by Samantha Shannon.</strong> Every time I went to a bookstore after this book came out, I would pick it up and then put it back down. Over and over and over I would do that. I finally picked it up in July and I loved it. Can't wait for the sequel.</p>
<p>6.<strong> Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling.</strong> It's about time, right? I know, I know. Stop judging me! This series is amazing. So amazing. Of course I own all the movies, I want to get the paperback box set now.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.</strong> This is the story about a woman that goes missing on her wedding anniversary and we find out if her husband was involved. Everyone is crazy. It's thrilling and unputdownable.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng.</strong> I finished this the most recently. Such a great book. When tragedy happens, we learn how a family copes. So good.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Red Rising by Pierce Brown.</strong> What can I say about this book? Great read, great story, great writing. A lot of emotions.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone Trilogy by Laini Taylor.</strong> Such a great story and beautifully written. I didn't want the story to end. I still think about the characters wondering what they could be doing.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Vicious by V.E. Schwab</strong>. Have you read this yet? Well have you? HAVE YOU? You'll understand. I mean, maybe. Everyone doesn't have the same taste. I highly recommend this book though. So good. No. So great.</p>
