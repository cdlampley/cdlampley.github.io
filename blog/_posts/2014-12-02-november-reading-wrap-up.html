<p>I read 3 books! That is 2 more books than last month. I'm improving!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18079804-half-bad?ac=1">Half Bad</a> by Sally Green</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The story focuses on Nathan, who is a half code. He's half white and black witch. The white witches are considered good and the black witches are bad. The story details Nathan's life throughout the years leading up to his 17th birthday where it will be determined whether he will be classified as a white or black witch. Being classified as a black witch could lead to his death.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the story. But I did feel like something was missing. Anytime I found out something that might have been meant to shock me, my response was "okay". I do plan on reading the next one in the series. I was left with wanting to know what happened next.</p>
<p>3/5 stars</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7260188-mockingjay?from_search=true">Mockingjay</a> by Suzanne Collins</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> People have read this trilogy, right? I mean, I don't have to actually summarize it. Katniss, hunger games, district uprisings, President Snow, Peeta, Prim. Keyword summary for the win!</p>
<p>I actually liked this one. Its the end of the trilogy and I knew before going into it that the majority of people hated this book or it was their least favorite. The first book is my favorite. The last two could be a toss up. Maybe I just like to be different. I will say that I would not have been mad if there was another book. Not after Mockingjay. One between Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Would not have been mad about that. Maybe that's why I'm enjoying that there are 4 movies. I saw Mockingly part 1 and loved it.</p>
<p>4/5 stars</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538873-mr-penumbra-s-24-hour-bookstore">Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore</a> by Robin Sloan</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> A bookstore, google, and "secret society". Clay Jannon gets a job working the night shift at a 24 hour bookstore. People come in who only get books from the back where you don't purchase, you borrow. Things lead to reorganizing the store database that leads to finding out the secret happenings.</p>
<p>This book was fun. Enjoyed it and also at points wondered if anything was going on. It was really fun though. I would love to work at this bookstore.</p>
<p>4/5 stars</p>
