<p><strong>Day:</strong> #4&#160;<br /><strong>Current Read:</strong> The Magicians <br /><strong>Books Finished:</strong> 1&#160;<br /><strong>Pages Read Since Last Update:</strong> 64&#160;<br /><strong>Total Pages Read in Read-A-Thon:</strong> 470&#160;<br /><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Maybe if I start reading before 7&#160;pm, I might get more reading done. Also, maybe if I don&#8217;t go to the bookstore and buy a new book around 8:30 (during that reading time) I might get more reading done. AND maybe if a Simpsons marathon did not begin, more reading would have been done. No, I won&#8217;t blame The Simpsons. I should be able to multitask. I am enjoying this book a lot though and getting to know these characters.</p>
