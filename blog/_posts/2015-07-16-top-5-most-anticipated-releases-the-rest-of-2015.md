<p>I did a blog post on my <a href="http://cherielampley.com/blog/2015/06/09/top-ten-most-anticipated-releases-for-the-rest-of-2015/">top 10 most anticipated releases</a> in June. Some of those books have already come out. After launching my <a href="http://youtube.com/user/cherielampley">BookTube channel</a>, I joined the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/118368-top-5-wednesday">Top 5 Wednesday</a> group on <a href="http://goodreads.com">GoodReads</a>. This weeks topic is to list my top 5 most anticipated releases.</p>
