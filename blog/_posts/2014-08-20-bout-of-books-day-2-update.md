<p><strong>Day:</strong> #2&#160;<br /><strong>Current Read:</strong> Insurgent by Veronica Roth <br /><strong>Books Finished:</strong> 1 (Divergent) <br /><strong>Pages Read Since Last Update:</strong> 215&#160;<br /><strong>Total Pages Read of Read-A Thon:</strong> 364&#160;<br /><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I finished a book! In re-reading Divergent, I found that I actually liked it more than I thought. I changed my Goodreads rating from a 3 to a 4. I might even go as far as to give it a 4.5. I&#8217;m going to continue on to the next book in the trilogy, Insurgent.</p>
