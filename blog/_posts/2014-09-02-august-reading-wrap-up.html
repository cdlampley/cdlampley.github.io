<p style="text-align:left;">Here is my August reading wrap up. I read 6 books. It was a decent month. Started out strong with my favorite book of the year, but ended not so great.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>1. Vicious by V.E. Schwab</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">- I wrote a <a href="https://cheriedlampley.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/vicious-by-v-e-schwab-book-review/">post</a> on how wonderful this book is. Have you purchased this book yet to find out how wonderful it is? WHY NOT??? <strong><em>Infinity/5</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>2. The 5th Wave by Rick Yancey</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">- This book was wonderful too. I can not wait for the sequel. If you have not heard of this book, it is about an alien invasion in waves. It follows Cassie and her attempt to keep her promise to her little brother. Zombie and his attempt to notÂ be the coward he thinks he is. Its wonderful and the sequel comes out in September. It will definitely be in my September wrap up. <strong><em>5/5</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>3. Isla and the Happily Ever After by Stephanie Perkins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">- I loved Anna and the French Kiss. I really really liked Lola and the Boy Next Door. I liked Isla and the Happily Ever After. It was okay. I think I would have liked this better if it was dual narrative with Isla and Josh. It was still enjoyable and it made me smile a few times, but it wasn't a favorite. <em><strong>3/5</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>4. Divergent by Veronica Roth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">- This was a re-read. I read it earlier this year and decided to read it again during the bout-of-books marathon (I had planned to marathon the series, but got sidetracked). I'm happy I read it again. I enjoyed it more the second time around and raised my goodreads rating. I will finish the series soon. <em><strong>4/5</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>5. Angelfall by Susan Ee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">- I thought this book was ok. I listened to it as an audiobook and wonder if I would have thought differently if i'd read it instead. I don't think so. It just didn't do it for me. The whole girl crushing/wanting another species is not an interest for me right now. I'm kind of done with those. Well, after I read the twilight series. I promise I'm going to read that series at some point. I've seen all the movies. I got halfway through the first book when I put it down. I think I'll pick it up sometime. <em><strong>3/5</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>6. The Magicians by Lev Grossman</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">- I don't know. I really just don't know. If you are going into this book because someone told you it was Harry Potter for adults, take the book back to the bookstore. Give it to someone else. Or put it on your bookshelf and don't pick it back up until you forget that someone told you that. I started really enjoying this book. Then I wondered when something was actually going to happen. Then it happened and it became so hard to finish. I don't know if I'm going to continue on to book two. I kind of wanted to since it is becoming a TV show and I do want to know what happens next. <em><strong>3/5</strong></em></p>
