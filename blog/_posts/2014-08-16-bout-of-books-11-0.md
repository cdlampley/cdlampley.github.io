<p style="text-align:left;">All I do is read, read, read no matter what! Sorry, not sorry :)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Anyway, as you can see in the title of this post, I will be participating in Bout of Books 11.0. What is that exactly?</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bout of Books read-a-thon is organized by Amanda @ On a Book Bender and Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal. It is a week long read-a-thon that begins 12:01am Monday, August 18th and runs through Sunday, August 24th in whatever time zone you are in. Bout of Books is low-pressure, and the only reading competition is between you and your usual number of books read in a week. There are challenges, giveaways, and a grand prize, but all of these are completely optional. <b>For all Bout of Books 11 information and updates, be sure to visit the <a href="http://boutofbooks.blogspot.com/">Bout of Books</a> blog. </b>- From the Bout of Books team</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This is going to be interesting and we will see how this goes. I work full time and I'm currently editing my manuscript. Going to be an interesting week.</p>
