<p>Thursday nights have become my "look for a new handbag" night the last few weeks. I'm not sure why. Actually, yes I am. I want a new bag! I just can't decide which one I want. I'll usually eye one throughout the night and think about purchasing it but get distracted by television. Then Friday morning comes around and I still don't have a new bag. Above is the current one I'm eyeing. I don't have a <a href="http://www.katespade.com/is-this-seat-taken%3F-terry/PXRU3872-1,default,pd.html?dwvar_PXRU3872-1_color=298&amp;start=7&amp;cgid=sale">Kate Spade</a> bag yet and I need something that pretty much fits my whole life. Yep. I'm one of those that carries everything with her. Also, the fact that there is a hashtag on this bag makes it a need on my list.</p>
<p>There are other things I could be doing right now besides looking for a new bag. Like editing my sister's book. Yes, my sister has written a book and she has put her trust in me to edit it. I actually like editing. No red ink though. I'm using purple while I edit it on my iPad. I'll edit after I finish this post.</p>
<p>So Apple has taken over my life. I'm typing on a MacBook, my phone is an iPhone, I have an iPod Classic somewhere in my apartment, the iPad has tried to kidnap me from this here MacBook, and I now have an Apple TV. I don't know what happened. I was always a reasonable person. Its not like I've always had Apple Products; the 4s is my first iPhone. Before that I had a Palm Centro, Blackberry Curve, and HTC EVO. I had a Dell before the MacBook. I had a Sansa something before the iPod and a Roku before the Apple TV. I like the Roku and still have it. Airplay is really nice though.</p>
<p>Now I'm just rambling. I seem to do that without college football in my life. Sigh...I miss it. I miss it so much that I took a vacation day for National Signing Day. Next Wednesday I will be at home, hanging out on twitter and watching all the high school seniors tell us where they will be going to school to play football. I'm not getting paid to do this. This is some kind of entertainment for me. When I write it down, it seems a bit...I don't know...weird. Oh well, I'll be that! This reminds me though that I need to schedule off for the first week of March Madness.</p>
