<p>Okay. I almost forgot. I'm currently watching the Big Ten Championship game. I'm currently really happy. My Buckeyes are up 45-0. Oh buddy. That score is a beauty. Anyway, I'm gonna get back to the game. I'll leave you with an awesome video done by the Ohio State video people regarding this game. Go Bucks!</p>
