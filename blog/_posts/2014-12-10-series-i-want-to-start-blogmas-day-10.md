<p style="text-align:center;">I believe I missed a day. I was walking into work this morning and it came to me. I missed yesterday. Oops. Well I will try not to let that happen again. Down to business. I want to talk about series today. Series I want to read. Series I probably should have already read. I have 8. These are in no particular order. Hopefully I can read most of these in 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Lunar Chronicles</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/11235712.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="475" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I already own the first two of this series. I might as well start it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Chaos Walking Trilogy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/2118745.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="475" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I've heard really good things about this trilogy. Been meaning to pick it up. Still haven't done it yet. It's on my list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Grisha Trilogy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/10194157.jpg" alt="" width="317" height="475" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As mentioned before regarding another series, I already own the first two. I don't know why I keep buying books and not reading them. Oh yes I do. Because I'm able :)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Mistborn</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/6547258.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="475" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I have the first book on audiobook. I've decided I'd rather read these instead of listening. So, picking these up will be something I do next year. Oh and the UK covers, of course. They're awesome.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Darkest Minds Trilogy</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/10576365.jpg" alt="" width="313" height="475" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Own the first one. It's been on my TBR many times this year. Still has yet to be read. Sigh.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Infernal Devices / Mortal Instruments</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/7171637.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="451" />  <img class="alignnone" src="assets/256683.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="449" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Okay. This could be considered two different series. Own Clockwork Angel. None of the others. Will change that. Need to know what everyone is talking about.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shatter Me Series</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/13455782.jpg" alt="" width="316" height="475" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Heard good things. Heard each book gets better and better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Legend the Series</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img class="alignnone" src="assets/9275658.jpg" alt="" width="314" height="475" /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">I listened to the first book on audiobook and really enjoyed it. Just haven't gotten around to getting the others.</p>
