<p align="left">If you don't know, I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/thesportsdiva">@thesportsdiva</a> is me). I love it. I'm on it all the time. More than pretty much any other social networking site (yes even Facebook and Myspace). But for some reason, it is getting hard for me to try to talk some of my friends into joining twitter. I think it's because they don't know what it is. This is what twitter says it is:</p>
<blockquote><p align="left">&quot;Twitter is a service for friends, family, and co&#8211;workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent answers to one simple question: <strong>What are you doing?&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Twitter is like updating your Facebook (and now Myspace) statuses. Being able to reply to other peoples statuses. You can find out about news before hearing it other places (yes friends, this is where I find out about some things). You can meet new people. You can follow newspapers and websites and TV channels. It is truly a fun place. </p>
<p align="left">And don't think that you have to sit in front of your computer to be on twitter. Twitter has a mobile website. Twitter has mobile applications. I use <a href="http://www.mitreo.com/motwit_twitter_palm_os/">MoTwit</a> for my Centro. There are apps for the Blackberry, the Iphone, and other mobile phones. Most of my no more than 140 character Tweets (a term that can be used when you twitter) come from my phone. </p>
<p align="left">Twitter just seems to be getting more popular. Both <a href="http://twitter.com/barackobama">Barack Obama</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/johnmccain">John McCain</a> used twitter accounts to get support for their campaigns. <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/19/omg-britney/">Britney Spears</a> (her people) is twittering. During this election, most people are <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/chat/1259140,election_night_twitter.article">following</a> twitter. Twitter is just where it is. </p>
<p align="left">So friends, please set up twitter accounts and @ me!</p>
<p align="left"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> How did I forget this. <a href="http://www.twitpic.com">Twitpic.com</a>. See something crazy or just want to show a pic to the people on twitter? Send it to Twitpic.com. It will show up on your twitter timeline for everyone to see.</p>
