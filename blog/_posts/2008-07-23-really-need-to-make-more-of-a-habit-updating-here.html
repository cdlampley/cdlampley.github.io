<p>I've been bored today. BORED! The boyfriend was here and we "hung out" then he got on the computer and was consumed all afternoon. I thought about watching a movie but it's hard to watch another movie after watching <a href="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com">The Dark Knight</a>. Yes I saw it and yes I loved it. I didn't talk about it here? Sorry. I meant to but who knows what happened.</p>
<p>Sometimes I hate having a day off in during the week. Yes it's nice and I always think that I'll get things done then it ends up being 4:30 pm and I still have yet to move off of my bed. Soon I won't have to worry about that. To do list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Find a job!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. This whole going back to school thing and spending my days writing seemed so glamorous at the time I walked into my bosses job and let them know my last day would be August 29th. But I'm gonna need to find a bartender/server job to moonlight on all of that.</p>
<p>So if anyone knows of a good sports bar (need to be around sports of course) I should apply at in Columbus, Ohio, just let me know :)</p>
