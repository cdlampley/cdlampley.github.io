<p>The first month of 2015 is over! It was a good month. Goals were accomplished. I do wish I had read more, but that's okay. Here are things I've did in the month of January.</p>
<p><strong>1. I read 2 books</strong><br />
Yep. Just 2 books. Those books are <a title="The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P by Adelle Waldman â€“ Review" href="https://cheriedlampley.wordpress.com/2015/01/11/the-love-affairs-of-nathaniel-p-by-adelle-waldman-review/"><em>The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P</em> by Adelle Waldman</a> and <em>Golden Son</em> by Pierce Brown. I have a review on this site for the first book mentioned. My words are still forming for Golden Son. A discussion needs to be had though. It will be had soon.</p>
<p><strong>2. I finished my first class in the Skillcrush Web Developer Blueprint</strong><br />
In my resolutions post, I mentioned I wanted to take learning to code seriously this year. I've done that so far. Will be continuing in February.</p>
<p><strong>3. I watched Ohio State win a National title!<br />
</strong>Of course I was going to mention this. How could I not?</p>
<p><strong>4. I "participated" in Bout of Books</strong><br />
Quotations are around participated because, well, I read one book during it. It was also a very busy week for me at work. Note to self: Don't do read-a-thons during the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><strong>5. I went to the Ohio State vs. Maryland game</strong></p>
