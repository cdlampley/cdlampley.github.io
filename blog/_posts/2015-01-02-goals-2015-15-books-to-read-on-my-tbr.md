<p>Happy New Year everyone! I have some goals for 2015. One of those goals is to read what I actually own.</p>
<p>I have TBR shame. Lots and lots of TBR shame. I have a lot of books sitting on my shelf, waiting for me to read them. I'm adding 15 of them to my TBR for 2015. They are in no particular order.</p>
