<p>I had a <a href="http://www.sandisk.com/products/catalog(1166)-sandisk_sansa_e200_series_mp3_players.aspx">Sansa</a>. I wasn't to fond of it but it worked for me. Now, it seems I have misplaced it. Not really sure where exactly it is. I haven't seen it in few months actually. Not sure if I got mad at it one day and decided to pith it. But why would I have kept the USB cable? Found that. </p>
<p>I'm thinking of purchasing an <a href="http://www,apple.com">IPod Nano</a> today. I'm not all that fond of it's looks though. The inner beauty of it is obviously great though. I'm allowed to be vain about this right? I mean, I'm the one who is gonna have to look at it everyday. It will block out all the noise on the bus though. Maybe I'll just run to <a href="http://www.radioshack.com">Radio Shack</a> real quick and take a look at it. </p>
