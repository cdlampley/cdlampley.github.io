<p style="text-align: center;">And the book buying ban begins...now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I wasn't supposed to add to my TBR pile this much so far this year. I had a plan to participate in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%230by16&amp;src=tyah">#0by16</a>. Or at least the Read 5, buy 1 plan. I'm going to do that now. I have to read 5 books before I can even think of buying another. Seriously, I have to get my book buying under control. Below are the physical books I've purchased so far since December 26 (Boxing day).</p>
