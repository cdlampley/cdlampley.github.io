<p>I'm doing a <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/118368-top-5-wednesday">Top 5 Wednesday</a> on a Wednesday! But of course I'm not doing the current week's topic. That would be too normal for me. I'm doing last weeks. My top 5 re-reads. I don't re-read books a lot. Not really. I've decided to list the 5 books I want to re-read, maybe next year. Possibly next year. At least a couple of them, I believe I will re-read next year. Here they are.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger</strong></p>
<p>I haven't read this in over 10 years. No wait. I think I read it again before the movie came out. Still, it has been a while.</p>
<p><strong>2. Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling</strong></p>
<p>This will be re-read always. ALWAYS.</p>
<p><strong>3. Vicious by V.E. Schwab</strong></p>
<p>Oh how I love this book. Oh how I want to know what these characters are doing right now.</p>
<p><strong>4. The History of Love by Nicole Krauss</strong></p>
<p>This book is a beauty. Haven't read it in years and the re-read is overdue.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank</strong></p>
<p>This book is definitely getting re-read in 2014. Most likely January. We will see if I remember when I do my TBR for next month.</p>
