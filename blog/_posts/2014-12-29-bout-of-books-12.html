<p>I'm back for my second Bout of Books! The first one I did was in <a title="Bout of Books 11.0" href="https://cheriedlampley.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/bout-of-books-11-0/">August</a>. I did...okay. Words were read. That's all that matters. Below is information regarding Bout of Books if you would like to join. My TBR is currently TBA. I'm still figuring that out. Will let you know when I know.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bout of Books read-a-thon is organized by Amanda @ On a Book Bender and Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal. It is a week long read-a-thon that begins 12:01am Monday, January 5th and runs through Sunday, January 11th in whatever time zone you are in. Bout of Books is low-pressure, and the only reading competition is between you and your usual number of books read in a week. There are challenges, giveaways, and a grand prize, but all of these are completely optional. <b>For all Bout of Books 12 information and updates, be sure to visit the <a href="http://boutofbooks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bout of Books</a> blog. </b>- From the Bout of Books team</p></blockquote>
