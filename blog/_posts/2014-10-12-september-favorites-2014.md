<p>Ok. I understand that it is currently October 12th, but I just thought about doing this. I think I've done this in the past. Maybe. Not really sure. What I do know is that I'm going to do this on a monthly basis. What kind of post is this exactly? This is a post with my favorite things during that month. From books, music, and other things. Â Here are my favorite things for the month of September.</p>
<p><strong>Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288043-gone-girl"><img class="alignnone" src="http://images.abovethetreeline.com/ea/CENG/images/jacket_covers/original/9781594136054.jpg?width=1000" alt="Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn" width="227" height="343" /></a></p>
<p>I expressed my love for this book in my <a href="http://cheriedlampley.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/september-wrap-up-football-did-this/">September reading wrap up</a>. It was so good. And I have seen the movie. I may do a post for both the movie and the book before the month is over.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Taylor Classics</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.converse.com/regular/chuck-taylor-classic-colors/MP_51.html?dwvar_MP__51_color=black&amp;dwvar_MP__51_size=040"><img class="alignnone" src="http://demandware.edgesuite.net/aalw_prd/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-masterCatalog_Converse/default/dwda7466d3/images/products/M9166/M9166_standard.png?sw=580&sh=580&sm=fit" alt="" width="235" height="235" /></a></p>
<p>I've been thinking about getting a pair of Chuck Taylors for a while. I would talk about it but not actually purchase a pair. Now I have them and love them. So comfortable and simple.</p>
<p><strong>Shake it Off by Taylor Swift and New Flame by Chris Brown feat. Usher</strong></p>

<p>These two songs were played A LOT during September. And will continue to be on my playlist for the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong>College football is back!</strong></p>
<p>The books on my book shelf may be a little upset with me because I've given all my attention to college football on Saturdays. They'll get over it. I'm not taking college football for granted either. I'm watching everything. The video is a highlight video oh Ohio State's game on 9/13 (my birthday!).</p>
