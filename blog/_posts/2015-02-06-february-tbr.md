<p>I did not post a TBR in January. I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to read. Also, in the past I was bad about sticking to a TBR. So for the month of February, I've decided to choose 3 books that I definitely want to read this month. I'm sure I'll read at least a fourth book. I'm going to decide on that one when I get there.</p>
