<p>I almost didn't make a TBR for October since I flailed miserably last month. But the past is the past! Let's move on. I have 4 books here. One that I'm almost done with. Yay for that! Maybe I'll read more. Maybe my TBR will change. Maybe I'll crawl into a ball and not want to read anything. I guess we'll find out :)</p>
<p>1. Anna Dressed in Blood by Kendare Blake</p>
<p>2. Night Film by Marisha Pessl</p>
<p>3. Hollow City by Ransom Riggs</p>
<p>4. Horns by Joe Hill</p>
