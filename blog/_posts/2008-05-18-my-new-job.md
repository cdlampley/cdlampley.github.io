<p>Just an update....</p>
<p>I've been writing <a href="http://www.tsdmagazine.com">The Sports Diva Magazine</a> for almost a year now and have been contributing to <a href="http://www.epiccarnival.com">Epic Carnival</a> for a few months. Now I will be writing for <a href="http://www.dejuiced.com">DEJUICED</a>! You can read all about my excitement for it in <a href="http://www.tsdmagazine.com/2008/05/divas-guide-t-1.html">my TSD post</a>. And this is just the beginning....</p>
<p>I CAN'T BE STOPPED! </p>
