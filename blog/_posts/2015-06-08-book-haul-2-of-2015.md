<p>I tried. I tried. That is all I can say. I gave in and continue to give into my love for buying books. I've read 5 of these, so that is a good thing, right? But it does not explain me not following the read 5, buy 1 plan. Maybe I'll try that again. Anyway, let us just get into it. Here is the book haul.</p>
