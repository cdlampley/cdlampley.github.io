<p>I haven't updated this blog lately. Sorry:( I've been busy though in a good way. I have been writing and editing <a href="http://www.tsdmagazine.com">The Sports Diva Magazine</a> and this week was my first writing for <a href="http://www.dejuiced.com">Dejuiced</a>. I'll do my best to update here as much as possible. </p>
<p>I'm almost done reading <a href="http://www.sloanecrosley.com">I Was Told There'd Be Cake by Sloane Crosley</a>. Reading it makes me want to write a collection of essays. I will get the chance to write my book one day. How bout a collection of essays called Diva's Guide To Sports? I already have a weekly series for my blog with that title. I'll think about it.</p>
<p>After I read that book, it will be time to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sixteen-Candles-Chicks-Novel-Williams/dp/1423110323/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211761367&amp;sr=8-1">Sixteen Candles</a> by <a href="http://www.tiawilliams.net/blog/">Tia Williams</a>. Yes, I read teen lit. It's the second book in the series and if it is anything like the first I will LOVE it.</p>
<p>Have a happy memorial day everyone! </p>
