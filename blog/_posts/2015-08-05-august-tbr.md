<p>Happy August! This month I will be participating in the BookTubeAThon. It is a weekly read-a-thon that begins on Monday August 3rd and end on Sunday August 9th. I will be in the middle of this read-a-thon when you see this post. There are different challenges for this read-a-thon that I discuss in this video.</p>

<p>After the read-a-thon is over, I will still need some books to read. I hope to get a lot of reading done this month. Football season comes back in September which makes me very excited and my weekends not asÂ free for reading as they have been this summer. Here are the books I plan to read this month.</p>
