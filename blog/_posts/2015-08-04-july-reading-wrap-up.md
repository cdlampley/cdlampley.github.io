<p>I read a total of 6 books in the month of July. Not bad at all. Unless you think about the read-a-thons I attempted to participate in. I will say only one was truly a success if you want to call it a success. That would beÂ #TBRTakedown 2.0. Here is my video of the books I read in the month of July.</p>
