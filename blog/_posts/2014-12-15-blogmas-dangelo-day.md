<p>Did D'Angelo take over your day? He did mine. I did not stay up last night to get the album at midnight. 1) I was sleepy. 2) I had to get up early. We'll ignore the fact that I woke up late this morning. Anyway, I did listen to this album when I got to work and MY GOODNESS, it was so worth the wait. My plan today was to listen to Nicki Minaj's new album. D'Angelo messed that up. I've listened to some of The Pinkprint and plan to listen to it more this week. I have to say, the music I've bought this year have been really good. Found some good music. I'll talk about that later in a post of my favorite music of 2014. I need to re-listen to some things to name my favorites.</p>
<p>If you aren't aware of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/id950764300">Black Messiah</a> album, and need a sneak peak, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dangelomusicofficial/sugah-daddy">here you go!</a></p>
