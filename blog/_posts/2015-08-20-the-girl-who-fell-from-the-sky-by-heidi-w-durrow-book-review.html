  book_review_summary: |-
    This is a coming of age story about a girl named Rachel who is the sole survivor of a family tragedy. She is biracial and moves across the country to live with her grandmother in a predominately black neighborhood. She has light brown skin and blue eyes. We follow Rachel as she finds her identity and whether or not she is able to deal with the choices that were made for her on the day of the tragedy.

    I loved this book. I felt a connection with all the characters. I was able to understand what Rachel was going through as well as everyone else. I highly recommend this book.
