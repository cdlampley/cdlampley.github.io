<p>So I have finally decided what I'm going to write about in my novel. It's a YA novel too so it's a bit fun to write. It involves middle school life, high school football stardom, crushes, football, family issues, football, meeting new friends, college recruiting, and did I mention football.</p>
<p>If you don't know by now, I love football. You can read all about my love of football, especially Ohio State football, <a href="http://www.tsdmagazine.com" target="_blank">here</a>. And if I can include football into my novel it will make writing even more fun. Maybe if I start mentioning how many words I've written here it will help me be more motivated to write. If I haven't updated my word count, please don't hesitate to yell at me. I really want to finish this book. </p>
