<p style="text-align: left;">The NCAA Tournament is here! I love this time of year. Basketball on all day. ALL DAY. I also love filling out a bracket. I'm not one of those people that take the bracket to seriously. I also don't get apart of bracket pools where money is involved. Below is my bracket. Below that are 5 things I noticed after filling out my bracket late last night. I usually wait until the last minute to fill out a bracket. I'll be on <a href="http://twitter.com/thesportsdiva" target="_blank">Twitter</a> all day on Thursday if you want to chat. As for Friday, there is a possibility I go see Insurgent in the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. All Ohio teams winning at least one game.</strong> I usually do this. As long as they aren't playing each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. UK winning it all.</strong> This is not shocking as a lot of people have UK winning it all. I've never picked an actual winner when filling out my bracket before though.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Ohio State to the Elite Eight.</strong> This is because I just felt like. That is all.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Kansas out early.</strong> I don't trust them. I almost had them lose their first game. I don't trust this team.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. B1G love.</strong> I didn't realize when filling the bracket out the love I was showing the B1G. I'm cool with that. It is my conference after all.</p>
