<p>I enjoyed this book, but did not love it. I loved the first 3rd of this book. The middle dragged too much for me though. I would have preferred this book being 50 pages shorter. I still enjoyed it. There is going to be the sequel and I might pick it up. If you are looking for a new thriller to read, I recommend picking this up.</p>
