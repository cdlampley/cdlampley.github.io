<p>As I write this, I'm on my way to work. On my Centro. And usually when I get home from work I get back online to work on the blogs. If you don't know which ones I speak of they are listed to your right. </p>
<p>But is that the only time I'm online? Of course not. I don't just blog and then put the computer away. After I work I play. If you again look to your rigjt you will find certain obsessions of mine. From Twitter to Last.fm. Of course most of these I can check from the Centro. But that's mostly when I'm on the go like right now.</p>
<p>And then of course there are the newspapers. Of course I read the Dispatch but there are the other Ohio dailies and others I love to read. And we can't forget about the countless blogs I subscribe too.  </p>
<p>So maybe I do spend a lot of time online. But I see it being more productive then a waste of time. And just a heads up. TSD Mag is getting a podcast. Should be coming soon most likely weekly. I'm also looking into doing video. Mostly for TSD but who knows :)</p>
