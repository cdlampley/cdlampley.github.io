<p>If I have the time this month, these are the books I want to read during September.</p>
<p><strong>Gone Girl</strong> by <strong>Gillian Flynn</strong><br />
<strong>The Darkest Minds</strong> by <strong>Alexandra Bracken</strong><br />
<strong>Infinite Sea</strong> by <strong>Rick Yancey</strong><br />
<strong>The Queen of the Tearling</strong> by <strong>Erika Johansen</strong><br />
<strong>Throne of Glass</strong> by <strong>Sarah J. Maas</strong><br />
<strong>Red Rising</strong> by <strong>Pierce Brown</strong></p>
<p>I'm currently reading Gone Girl and loving it. We will see how weekend reading goes for me.  I watched a lot of football this past weekend and barely opened a book. I was also out hanging out with friends though. I will be home this weekend and I'm thinking I'll get more reading done. We'll see.</p>
