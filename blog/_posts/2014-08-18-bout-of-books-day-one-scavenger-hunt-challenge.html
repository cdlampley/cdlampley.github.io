<p>Hi (<em>Ross from Friends voice</em>).</p>
<p>I'm currently home sick from work. I've been in bed all day, but I wanted to do this challenge because, well, I needed to stand up for a moment. </p>
<p>This is the Scavenger Hunt challenge by <a href="http://thebookmonsters.com/">The Book Monsters</a>. There were 5 challenges. Here are the results below.</p>
<p><strong>1. A book that begins with a "B".</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://cheriedlampley.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-aug-18-11-43-04-am.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-185" src="assets/photo-aug-18-11-43-04-am.jpg?w=300" alt="Photo Aug 18, 11 43 04 AM" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Being Friends with Boys by Terra Elan McVoy.</em></strong> I haven't read this one yet. Its about a girl who is friends with a bunch of boys who just see her as a friend. Then a new boy comes along and sees her as a girl he's interested in and it messes with they dynamic of her and her guy friends. Sounded interesting.</p>
<p><strong>2. A book that has been made into a movie/TV show.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://cheriedlampley.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-aug-18-11-42-54-am.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-186" src="assets/photo-aug-18-11-42-54-am.jpg?w=300" alt="Photo Aug 18, 11 42 54 AM" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Divergent by Veronica Roth</strong></em>. I'm currently reading this. Its actually a re-read. I have to say, I think I like this better than I thought I did before. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. A series you love.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://cheriedlampley.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-jul-26-7-49-49-pm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-188" src="assets/photo-jul-26-7-49-49-pm.jpg?w=300" alt="Photo Jul 26, 7 49 49 PM" width="300" height="210" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Daughter of Smoke &amp; Bone by Laini Taylor.</strong></em> I LOVE THIS TRILOGY! I was doing my write up over the weekend before I almost keeled over with whatever sickness decided to show up and hang out. I should have that out soon. Oh, that reminds me, I need to do my 5th Wave write up. I really need to reevaluate my write ups. Later. Let me not get sidetracked.</p>
<p><strong>4. An anthology of poems or short stories.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://cheriedlampley.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-aug-18-11-43-12-am.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-184" src="assets/photo-aug-18-11-43-12-am.jpg?w=300" alt="Photo Aug 18, 11 43 12 AM" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>The Best American Short Stories 2002.</strong></em> I forgot I had this. I might have read a short story or 2. I have no idea. Its 12 years old. I can't think right now. Sick, remember?</p>
<p>5. A book on your TBR shelf or your full TBR shelves.</p>
<p><a href="https://cheriedlampley.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/photo-aug-18-11-47-12-am.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-183" src="assets/photo-aug-18-11-47-12-am.jpg?w=300" alt="Photo Aug 18, 11 47 12 AM" width="442" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>So yeah. Here is my current TBR. I forgot to include Insurgent and Allegiant, but I will be reading those this week so its fine to have not included them. But yeah. Actually, looking over at my bookshelf, I've noticed books that I haven't read yet that I didn't include. Well I consider these the books I plan on reading before the year is up. I think I just counted 25. I think I can do it. Football is coming so my free time is not as open as it has been. </p>
