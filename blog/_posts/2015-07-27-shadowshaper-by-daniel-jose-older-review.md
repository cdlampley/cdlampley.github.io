<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sierra Santiago was preparing to have a summer with no issues. One with her and her art. After a weird encounter with her grandfather, she attends a party when craziness breaks loose. She finds herself discovering a supernatural order called The Shadowshapers. These people connect with spirits through paintings, music, and stories. Someone is trying to rid the world of these Shadowshapers and she must find out who this person is and stop them before it's too late.</p>
<h3>Why I Picked It Up</h3>
<p>Definitely a cover buy. The cover is very beautiful. Also, a change from the majority of white YA protagonist was a plus.</p>
