<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This book begins in August of 1986. We first meet Park sitting on the bus hating everything around him. He lives for his music, his comic books, and the full seat he has all to himself on the bus. Then Eleanor enters the bus with all eyes on her. She tries to sit anywhere, but is turned away by everyone, until Park reluctantly tells her to sit down. Which begins them being seat mates. Then she starts to read his comics while he is reading them on the bus. Park starts to let her read them and brings her comics and music each day to take home. This is there interaction until Park asks her about the song lyrics written on her books. From there they become friends and then more.</p>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>Eleanor &amp; Park is a beautifully written story that felt real from the first word on the first page. This is the second book I read by Rainbow Rowell (first being Fangirl). Both books have given me real characters that people could identify with. E&amp;P gave us Park and his love for everything his dad doesnâ€™t understand until Eleanor. And Eleanor living in that small house with her beautiful mother who puts up with a bully of a stepfather and her sleeping in that small room with her siblings. It took me back to high school and first love. It made me smile. It made me feel sad. Goodness, it made me want to know what these characters were doing after the last page. There were only a few minor issues I had with this book, but I would be surprised if it did not end up as one of my favorites at the end of the year.</p>
