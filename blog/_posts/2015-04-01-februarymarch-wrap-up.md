<p>February was not a great reading month for me. That is why I decided to combine that month with March. I read 2 books in February and 4 in March. I like reading 4 books a month. That is my goal.</p>
<p>My favorite book I read in these months was The Raven Boys. I need to write up a review on that one as well as the other books I read.</p>
<p>There are reviewsÂ on The Red Queen and Eleanor &amp; Park if you want to check those out. Those are linked below. I enjoyed all the books I read and I am ready to read more in April.</p>
