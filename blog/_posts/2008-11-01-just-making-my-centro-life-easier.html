<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:12px;font-family:Trebuchet MS;">(Oh <a href="http://ahsirg.kvplab.com/dp/touchlauncher" target="_blank">TouchLauncher</a>, youâ€™re my hero)</span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Wingdings;"><span></span></span><span style="font-size:11pt;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:11pt;">So, I have a Palm Centro. Got it back in July. Sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it. And I'm always trying to find ways to make it better. Then I found <a target="_blank" href="http://ahsirg.kvplab.com/dp/">TouchLauncher</a>. I found it a while ago but never really used it. Was having issues with downloading but those issues are long gone. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:11pt;">The TouchLauncher has turned my Centro into a little IPhone, well sorta. I can scroll to different screens with my finger. I can move different icons with my finger. I can even change what the icon looks like. There are different iconsets that can be <a target="_blank" href="http://ahsirg.kvplab.com/dp/downloads/iconsets">downloaded</a> from the TouchLauncher website. Or you can make your own. I'm going to attempt to make some for the different websites I go to. Being able to just click on an icon for ESPN makes me happy. <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:11pt;">Here is a video I found on YouTube from the developer. If you get TouchLauncher or have it already, let me know what you think of it.<br /></span></p>
