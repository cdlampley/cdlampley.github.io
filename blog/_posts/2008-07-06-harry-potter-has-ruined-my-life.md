<p>I love to read. I really do. But don't be surprised that I have never read a single Harry Potter book. Nor have I seen one of the movies, maybe bits and pieces but not from beginning to end. Until this weekend. The <a href="http://abcfamily.go.com/abcfamily/path/section_Movies/page_Listing">ABC Family channel</a> decided to air the first 4 Harry Potter movies this weekend. I thought hey, why don't I watch them. And watch them I did. And with the 5th Harry Potter movie being on HBO On Demand, I just had to watch that as well. After watching, I'm of course intrigued. Because of this, I might have to see the next movie in the theater. Because of this, I might have to buy the books. I don't have time to read Harry Potter. I barely have time to read the last 4 books I've purchased. Now I have to add 7 more books to that list?</p>
