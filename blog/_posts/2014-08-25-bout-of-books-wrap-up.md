<p><strong>Thoughts:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>As you can see, my TBR changed. I finished Divergent and went to Insurgent that next afternoon. Read 11 pages, looked at my bookshelf and thought, "I want to read The Magicians instead". That pretty much ended my goal of reading more than 1 book. It's ok. I'm still reading this book. It's interesting. That's all I can really say about it. Over 200 pages in and I feel like I'm finally getting to the point of this book. I guess I'll find out. I will finish it within the next few days. I enjoyed bout of books. I only participated in one challenge. I'll try to make time for more challenges next time if I participate. </p>
