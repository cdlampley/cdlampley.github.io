 <p>Hello! I am a writer, web developer, and YouTuber living in Central Ohio.
 I am originally from Southwestern Ohio, but after I attended college in the area, I fell in love with it and couldnâ€™t go back.
 I am a self taught web developer. I would love to work with you if you need a website built.
 When I'm not working on perfecting my craft, you can find me with my nose in a book or rooting for one of my favorite teams and discussing these things on my blog.</p>
