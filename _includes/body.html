<!-- About Info -->
<div class="col-md-6">
	<h3>Hello! My name is Cherie and I'm a Writer & Web Developer.</h3>
<p>I am a self taught coder living in Central Ohio. I'm originally from Southwestern Ohio, but after I attended college in the area, I fell in love with it and couldnâ€™t go back.</p> 
<p>I always found myself in front of the computer. I remember being excited when I created my first blog and learned how to create a hyperlink. I have since gone deeper with my education in learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Ruby. With this knowledge I am able to build responsive interactive websites and apps.</p>
<p>When Im not building websites, you can find me with my nose in a book or rooting for one of my favorite teams and discussing these things on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/cherielampley">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
